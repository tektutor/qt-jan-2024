- this is a cross-platform framework that supports Linux, Windows, Mac OS-X, Android, ios, Embedded Systems
- developed by the Qt company
- Qt framework is available in 2 flavours
  - Qt Opensource
  - Qt Enterprise for commercial use
- Qt allows developers to write applications once and run them on multiple platforms. This greatly simplifies the development process for applications that need to work across different operating systems.
- Qt provides a wide range of widgets (or controls) that can be used to design highly interactive user interfaces
  - These widgets include buttons, text boxes, labels, menus, and many more.
- supports 2D and 3D graphics application development
- Qt supports modules for network programming, which helps in writing applications that can communicate over TCP/IP.
- Qt supports bluetooth, IPC, Threads and Synchronization mechanisms
- supports internationalization and localization, allowing applications to be adapted for various languages and regions
- While Qt is primarily used with C++, bindings exist for other languages like Python, enabling a broader range of developers to use it
- The Qt framework is highly versatile and can be used to develop a wide range of applications across various platforms. Some of the key types of applications that can be developed using Qt include:

- Qt Framework is used for developing
  - Desktop Applications
  - Embedded Systems and IoT Devices
  - Mobile Applications - Android and ios
  - Industrial & Scientific Applications
  - Automotive Infotainment Systems
  - Medical applications
  - 2D and 3D Graphics Applications
  - Simulation and Training Software
  - Games
  - Multimedia Applications
  - Web Applications
  - Educational and Learning Softwares
  - Data Visualization Tools

## What is QML?
- helps in developing fluid GUI applications with Javascript like lange
- QML is JavaScript with Qt extensions

## What is Qt Creator?
- is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Qt application development
- can write code, build, debug and run Qt applications
- helps developing Qt Widget based applications and QML applications
